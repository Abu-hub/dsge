# Teaching material for a course on *DSGE Models* on a graduate level
Please feel free to use this for teaching or learning purposes, however, taking into account the license. If you spot mistakes, let me know.

Right now, this is just a collection of teaching materials I used in different courses. I will teach a course on DSGE models in the winter term 2018/19 and update and consolidate the material accordingly. Stay tuned.
