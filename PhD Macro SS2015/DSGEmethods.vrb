\frametitle{Exercise: Write your own MOD file}\framesubtitle{Steady-state}
Note that we could either compute the steady-state analytically and then use steady\_state\_model in our mod-file or good guesses for an initval block. If you want to use intival, you can use these values
\begin{verbatim}
k    = 20;
y    = 1;
l    = 0.5;
c    = 1.5;
A    = 1;
a    = 0;
i    = 0.5;
uc   = 0.5;
ul   = -1;
fk   = 0.1;
fl   = 3;
f    = 2;
\end{verbatim}
